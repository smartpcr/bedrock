# The End to End GitOps Deployment Pipeline

This deep dive will cover the operational details around the core GitOps based pipeline in Bedrock. The average service devops person can be blissfully unware of the details because Bedrock largely automates these implementation details, but it is still helpful to understand how all of it functions and fits together. Its workflow centers around three repositories: the application repo, the high level definition repo, and the resource manifest repo:

We will describe the high level definition repo in more detail later, but at a high level, it contains a higher level description of what should be deployed in a customer such that human pull request reviewers can better understand what is being proposed in an operational change.  The resource manifest repo, in contrast, is the raw YAML that is applied to Kubernetes to express the current state of the cluster.

These repositories are linked together by Azure Devops pipelines.  Between the application repo and the high level definition repo we have two types of pipelines. The first is the lifecycle management pipeline, which manages the creation and deletion of services and rings through pull requests on the high level definition repo. The second type of pipeline is created for each service that is contained in the application repo.  This pipeline is responsible for building the container for the service and creating a pull request on the high level definition repo to release them. You can learn more about the automation around establishing these pipelines and performing day to day tasks in our [Service Management walkthrough](./services.md).

Finally, the High Level Definition repository and the Resource Manifest repos are linked by a single pipeline that takes the high level definition of the deployment, builds it with Fabrikate, and checks the deployment YAML artifacts into the Resource Manifest repo.  You can learn more about automation around establishing this pipeline in our [GitOps Pipeline walkthrough](./gitops-pipeline.md).

## Deep Dive: High Level Definitions

In [Why GitOps?](./why-gitops.md) we discussed how the git repo of record contains the low level Kubernetes resource manifests and that commits against this repo are reconciled with Kubernetes by Flux to bring the cluster into the same state. We also saw in our [first workload walkthrough](../firstWorkload) how we could commit a simple set of resource manifests to this repo and that Flux would reconcile that change with the cluster.

In the real world, however, the Kubernetes resource manifests that comprise an application definition are typically very complex. For example, the resource manifests needed to deploy ElasticSearch can run to 500+ lines and the complete deployment of an Elasticsearch / Fluentd / Kibana (EFK) logging stack can be over 1200 lines. These resource manifests, by their YAML nature, are typically very dense, context free, and very indentation sensitive -- making them a dangerous surface to directly edit without introducing a high risk for operational disaster.

This has traditionally been solved in the Kubernetes ecosystem with higher level tools like [helm](http://helm.sh). Helm provides templating for the boilerplate inherent in these resource definitions and also provide a reasonable set of default configuration values. Helm continues to be the best way to generate the resource manifests for applications, and we use Helm in our GitOps CI/CD process, checking the generated resource manifests into the resource manifest git repo that we described previously.

That said, a second problem that you have to address when you start to compose a real world production Kubernetes deployment is that the resource manifests that describe the in-cluster workload tend to be composed of the combination of many Helm charts.  For example, to deploy the EFK logging stack above, you might want to generate resource manifests using four charts from helm/charts:  `stable/elasticsearch`, `stable/elasticsearch-curator`, `stable/fluentd-elasticsearch`, and `stable/grafana`.

While you could utilize shell scripts to do this or even create a large helm with subdependencies, this is brittle and not easy to share between deployments, something that is essential in large company contexts where they may have hundreds of clusters running and where reuse, leverage, and central maintenance is critical.

In Bedrock we utilize high level deployment definitions, which can themselves reference remote subcomponents.  In this way, you can compose the overall deployment out a set of common, centrally managed components. Such a stack for the above EFK logging stack might look like:

```json
{
    "name": "elasticsearch-fluentd-kibana",
    "type": "static",
    "path": "./manifests",
    "subcomponents": [
        {
            "name": "elasticsearch",
            "type": "helm",
            "source": "https://github.com/helm/charts",
            "method": "git",
            "path": "stable/elasticsearch"
        },
        {
            "name": "elasticsearch-curator",
            "type": "helm",
            "source": "https://github.com/helm/charts",
            "method": "git",
            "path": "stable/elasticsearch-curator"
        },
        {
            "name": "fluentd-elasticsearch",
            "type": "helm",
            "source": "https://github.com/helm/charts",
            "method": "git",
            "path": "stable/fluentd-elasticsearch"
        },
        {
            "name": "kibana",
            "type": "helm",
            "source": "https://github.com/helm/charts",
            "method": "git",
            "path": "stable/kibana"
        }
    ]
}
```

Such a deployment specification requires tooling and the Bedrock project maintains a tool called Fabrikate to generate the low level resource manifests from these high level definitions. It is intended to be executed as part of a CI/CD pipeline that sits between a high level definition of your deployment and the resource manifest repo that Flux watches. This enables the components of a deployment to be written at a higher (and hence less error prone) level and to be able to share those components amongst deployments.

A final problem that Fabrikate solves is that, in real world scale workloads, there are often multiple clusters deployed for the same workload for scale, reliability, and/or latency reasons. These clusters tend to only differ slightly in terms of their config and there is a strong desire to centralize the common config for these clusters such that it remains DRY.

Fabrikate solves this with composable configuration files. These configuration files are loaded and applied at generation time to build the final set of configuration values that are used during `helm template`. Using our EFK stack example from above, and since we know the different subcomponents that make up this stack, we can preconfigure the connections between these different subcomponents with config values with a configuration file that looks like this such that we can do this once in one spot:

```yaml
config:
subcomponents:
  elasticsearch:
    namespace: elasticsearch
    injectNamespace: true
  elasticsearch-curator:
    namespace: elasticsearch
    injectNamespace: true
    config:
      cronjob:
        successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 0
      configMaps:
        config_yml: |-
          ---
          client:
            hosts:
              - elasticsearch-master.elasticsearch.svc.cluster.local
            port: 9200
            use_ssl: False
  fluentd-elasticsearch:
    namespace: fluentd
    injectNamespace: true
    config:
      elasticsearch:
        host: "elasticsearch-master.elasticsearch.svc.cluster.local"
  kibana:
    namespace: kibana
    injectNamespace: true
    config:
      elasticsearchHosts: "http://elasticsearch-master.elasticsearch.svc.cluster.local:9200"
```

Fabrikate also enables you to override configuration such that you can utilize the same high level definition with a `common` set of configuration, but also differentiate the configuration applied to the `prod-east` and `prod-west` clusters with specific `prod-east` and `prod-west` configuration that preempts this `common` configuration.

Our EFK preconfigured stack above can be itself checked into a git repo and referenced from another high level deployment definition file.  For example, if we wanted to define a “cloud native” stack with all of the observability, service mesh, and management components included, we could express this with a deployment config that looks like:

```yaml
name: "cloud-native"
type: static
path: "./manifests"
subcomponents:
  - name: "elasticsearch-fluentd-kibana"
    source: "../elasticsearch-fluentd-kibana"
  - name: "prometheus-grafana"
    source: "../prometheus-grafana"
  - name: "linkerd2"
    source: "../linkerd2"
  - name: "kured"
    source: "../kured"
  - name: "jaeger"
    source: "../jaeger-operator"
  - name: "traefik"
    source: "../traefik"
```

Such a hierarchical approach to specifying deployments allows for the reuse of lower level stacks (like the EFK example above) and for updates to these dependent stacks to be applied centrally at the source -- as opposed to having to make N downstream commits in each deployment repo.
